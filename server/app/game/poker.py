Poker Game Flow (Basic Logic)

1. Initialize hand:
    - Shuffle deck and assign dealer/button position.
    - Deal two hole cards to each player.
    - Post blinds (small and big blind).

2. Preflop betting round:
    - Begin with player left of big blind.
    - In turn, each active player can fold, call, or raise.
    - Betting continues until all bets are matched or only one player remains.

3. Flop:
    - Deal three community cards face up.
    - Start new betting round with first active player left of dealer.

4. Turn:
    - Deal one community card (the turn).
    - Start new betting round.

5. River:
    - Deal final community card (the river).
    - Start last betting round.

6. Showdown:
    - If more than one player remains after final betting:
        - Reveal all active players' hole cards.
        - Evaluate each player's best 5-card hand using their two hole cards plus five community cards.
        - Player(s) with the strongest hand(s) win the pot (split if tied).

7. Cleanup and prepare for next hand:
    - Award chips from pot to winner(s).
    - Rotate dealer/button and blinds.
    - Reset player statuses, bets, and game state.
    - Start next hand.

Note:
- If at any point all but one player folds, last remaining player wins the pot immediately.
- Side pots may be created if players go all-in for different amounts (optional in initial implementation).
