# Neural CFR Implementation Requirements

# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.19.0
torch>=1.9.0                 # PyTorch for neural networks (optional - falls back to tabular CFR)

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
# tensorboard>=2.7.0         # For training visualization
# wandb>=0.12.0              # For experiment tracking
# scikit-learn>=0.24.0       # For clustering in card abstraction
# matplotlib>=3.3.0          # For plotting training curves
# seaborn>=0.11.0            # For enhanced visualizations

# Development dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=6.0.0              # For testing
# black>=21.0.0              # For code formatting
# flake8>=3.8.0              # For linting

# Installation instructions:
# 
# Minimal installation (CPU only):
# pip install numpy torch
#
# Full installation with GPU support:  
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# pip install numpy tensorboard matplotlib seaborn
#
# The implementation will work with just numpy if PyTorch is not available,
# falling back to pure tabular CFR (which is still functional).
